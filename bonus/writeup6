We can use the same file system extraction method again and look around a bit more. [[01]](https://github.com/Madasanya/boot2root/wiki/file_system)

As we know there is a frontend connected to a database we can check out the `/var/www/` directory a bit more. 

Inside the forums config folder we stumble upon the `db_settings.php`, which contains the password for _root_ of the database. 

```console
kali@kali:squashfs-root$ cat var/www/forum/config/db_settings.php
<?php
$db_settings['host'] = 'localhost';
$db_settings['user'] = 'root';
$db_settings['password'] = 'Fg-\'kKXBj87E:aJ$';
[...]
```

With this we can directly log into the database as root!
